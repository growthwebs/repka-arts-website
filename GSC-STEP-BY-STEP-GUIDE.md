137 pages were crawled but not indexed.

1. Under Excluded, find **"Crawled - currently not indexed"**
2. Click the number ‚Üí Export
3. **Save as**: `GSC_crawled_not_indexed.csv`

### What to analyze:
- Are these low-content pages?
- Do they have good unique content?

## Step 7: Create Your Analysis Spreadsheet ‚è±Ô∏è 10 minutes

Create a new Google Sheet or Excel file to organize your findings.

### Create these columns:

**Sheet 1: "404 Analysis"**
- Column A: URL
- Column B: Type (Product/Collection/Blog/Other)
- Column C: Status (Keep/Redirect/Remove)
- Column D: Action Required (what to do)
- Column E: Priority (High/Medium/Low)
- Column F: Notes

**Sheet 2: "Redirect Analysis"**
- Column A: Original URL
- Column B: Redirects to
- Column C: Chain length (1, 2, 3+ redirects)
- Column D: Type (HTTP‚ÜíHTTPS, Product‚ÜíCollection, etc.)
- Column E: Action Required

**Sheet 3: "Canonical Issues"**
- Column A: Page URL
- Column B: Has parameters? (Yes/No)
- Column C: Parameter type (sort_by, filter, etc.)
- Column D: Action Required

**Sheet 4: "Action Items"**
- Column A: Issue
- Column B: Priority
- Column C: Action
- Column D: Status
- Column E: Due Date

## Step 8: Quick Analysis - What to Look For ‚è±Ô∏è 15 minutes

### For 404 Pages:
1. **Look for patterns**:
   ```
   Are many URLs like this?
   - /collections/painting?sort_by=price
   - /products/old-artwork-123
   - /blogs/news/old-post
   ```

2. **Categorize them**:
   - Old products (discontinued)
   - Query parameter URLs (bad URLs)
   - Blog posts that were deleted
   - Broken internal links

3. **Decide what to do**:
   - **Old products**: Can ignore or submit removal request in GSC
   - **Query parameter URLs**: This is why you need canonical tags (already have them)
   - **Broken internal links**: Fix the links on your site
   - **Valid 404s**: Nothing - let them naturally decay

### For Redirect Chains:
1. **Check if they're normal**:
   - HTTP ‚Üí HTTPS is normal and fine
   - Product ‚Üí Product redirect might be old products merged

2. **If you see chains like**: A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C
   - Find where A originally links
   - Change it to point to C directly

### For Canonical Issues:
1. **Check if URLs have parameters**:
   ```
   Bad: /collections/art?sort_by=price&page=2
   Good: /collections/art (canonical should be this)
   ```

2. **If many have parameters**: Your canonical tags should handle this (they already do)

## Step 9: Prioritize Your Fixes ‚è±Ô∏è 10 minutes

Based on your analysis, create a priority list:

### High Priority (Do first):
1. Fix any broken internal links pointing to 404 pages
2. Add redirects for important old URLs that have backlinks
3. Review and fix any canonical issues on important pages

### Medium Priority:
1. Submit removal requests for old 404 pages with no backlinks
2. Optimize the 137 pages that are crawled but not indexed (add content)

### Low Priority (Monitor):
1. Let old 404s naturally decay
2. Most redirects are probably fine (HTTP‚ÜíHTTPS)

## Step 10: Take Action - Fix the Most Critical Issues ‚è±Ô∏è 30+ minutes

### If you found broken internal links:
1. Go to your Shopify admin
2. Find the pages with broken links
3. Update them to point to correct URLs

### If you need to add redirects:
1. Go to Shopify Admin ‚Üí Online Store ‚Üí Navigation
2. Or create redirects in bulk using apps or CSV

### If you need to improve content:
1. Go through the "crawled not indexed" pages
2. Add more content, images, descriptions
3. Make each page unique and valuable

## Step 11: Request Re-indexing (After making changes) ‚è±Ô∏è 2 minutes

1. In GSC, go to **URL Inspection** tool (left sidebar)
2. Enter the URLs you fixed
3. Click **"Request Indexing"**
4. Do this for important pages you've changed

## Step 12: Monitor Progress ‚è±Ô∏è 5 minutes/week

1. **Set a weekly reminder** to check GSC Coverage report
2. **Track improvements**:
   - Are 404 errors decreasing?
   - Are redirect chains improving?
   - Are more pages getting indexed?

3. **Document changes** in your spreadsheet

## Quick Reference: Expected Timeline

- **Week 1**: Fix critical issues (broken links, important redirects)
- **Week 2-3**: Request reindexing, monitor changes
- **Week 4-6**: See significant improvements in coverage
