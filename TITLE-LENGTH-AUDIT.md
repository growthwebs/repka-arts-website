**Character Count Analysis**

## HARDCODED TITLES (From Code):

### ‚úÖ **GOOD (50-60 chars):**
```

### üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES:**

1. **&amp; Problem:** 5+ titles use `&` character
2. **Too Short:** Privacy (38), Refunds (40) 
3. **Dynamic Titles:** Product/Collection titles could be any length!

## ANALYSIS: Why Titles Show `&amp;`

**Current Code (Line 361):**
```liquid
<title>{{ seo_title | escape }}</title>
```

**Problem:** `| escape` converts:
- `&` ‚Üí `&amp;`
- `<` ‚Üí `&lt;`
- `>` ‚Üí `&gt;`

**But:** Browsers automatically handle `&` correctly in `<title>` tags!

**Fix:** Remove `| escape` from title tags (keep for content where needed)
