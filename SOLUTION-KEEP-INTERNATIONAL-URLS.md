# Solution: Keep International URLs, Fix 404 Errors

## Your Situation

‚úÖ You want to keep the international URL structure (as Shopify recommends)  
‚ùå But these international URLs are returning 404 errors in Google Search Console  
‚ùå About 901 URLs total, with ~70% being internationalized product URLs

## The Real Problem

The issue isn't that you need to change your URL structure. The issue is likely:

1. **Old URLs still being discovered**: Google is finding old URLs from your previous website structure
2. **Old `/artwork/` URLs**: These need redirects to the new product URLs
3. **Market URLs that may have changed**: If you changed your market configuration, old market URLs now 404

## Solution: Strategic Redirects

Instead of changing your international URL structure, we need to:

### 1. Fix Old `/artwork/` URLs (About 180 URLs)

These are the old website structure URLs that need to redirect to the new product URLs.

**Action**: Create redirects from `/artwork/{name}` ‚Üí `/products/{name}`

### 2. Fix Old Legacy Pages (About 45 URLs)

Pages like:
- `/art/sold-works` ‚Üí redirect to appropriate page
- `/series/savannah-vibes` ‚Üí redirect to `/collections/savannah-vibes`
- `/resources` ‚Üí redirect to homepage or relevant page

### 3. Let International URLs Work Naturally

For the international product URLs (`es-int/products/`, `en-es/products/`, etc.), these should work if:
- Your markets are properly configured
- Products are published to those markets
- Products have translations in those languages

If these are 404ing, it might be because:
- They're being generated incorrectly in the sitemap
- Or they're old URLs from a previous market configuration

## Next Steps

### For the Old `/artwork/` URLs:

I need you to check:
1. **Do the old artwork names match your current product handles?**
   - Example: Does `/artwork/serenity-in-bloom-n1` match a current product named "serenity-in-bloom-n1"?
   - If yes, I can help you create bulk redirects

2. **If you're unsure**, I can help you:
   - Export a list of your current products
   - Match them to the old artwork URLs
   - Create the redirect CSV for Shopify

### For the International URLs:

We need to determine if they're actually valid or just old invalid URLs:
1. **Are your products currently accessible at international URLs?**
   - Try visiting: `repkaarts.com/es/products/some-product-name`
   - Does it work?
2. **If they don't work**, you might need to either:
   - Fix your market configuration
   - Or create redirects from the broken international URLs to the working URLs

## My Recommendation

Focus on the **old `/artwork/` URLs first** because:
1. These are clearly from your old website structure
2. They can be systematically redirected
3. This will fix ~180 of the 901 404 errors

For the international URLs:
- Check if they currently work on your site
- If they work, the GSC errors might be from old crawl data that will resolve
- If they don't work, we'll need to figure out why they're being generated

## Quick Check

Can you try visiting these URLs on your site right now:
1. `repkaarts.com/es/products/lilies-art-print` - Does it work?
2. `repkaarts.com/en/products/lilies-art-print` - Does it work?
3. `repkaarts.com/products/lilies-art-print` - Does it work?
4. `repkaarts.com/es-int/products/lilies-art-print` - Does it work?

This will tell us if:
- International URLs are working (then GSC errors are stale)
- Or if there's an issue with how they're being generated/served

**Can you test those URLs and let me know which ones work?** üôè
