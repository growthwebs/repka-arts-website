## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### **Issue #1: Why Descriptions Might Be >160 Chars**

**Potential Causes:**

#### A. **Shopify Admin Override**
**Location:** Product/Collection/Page admin → "Search engine listing preview" → Meta description field

**Problem:** If you manually set descriptions in Shopify Admin, they **override** the Liquid code.

**Check:** Go to any product/collection/page in Shopify Admin → scroll to "Search engine listing preview"
- If there's a description there, Shopify uses that INSTEAD of your code
- These admin descriptions don't respect character limits

**Solution:**
```
Option 1: DELETE meta descriptions from Shopify Admin (let code handle it)
Option 2: Manually ensure each admin description is 150-160 chars
```

---

#### B. **Product Descriptions Being Too Long**
**Location:** `repka-seo-master.liquid` line 192-210

**Current Logic:**
```liquid
if product.description != blank
  assign seo_description = product.description | strip_html | truncatewords: 25, '...'
```

**Problem:** `truncatewords: 25` doesn't guarantee 160 chars!
- 25 words could be 120-250 characters depending on word length
- Example: "Extraordinary Mediterranean watercolor painting" = 47 chars/4 words
  25 words × 11 chars avg = 275 characters! 🚨

**Fix Needed:**
```liquid
# BETTER: Use truncate by characters, not words
if product.description != blank
  assign seo_description = product.description | strip_html | truncate: 155, '...'
  # Ensure minimum length
  if seo_description.size < 140
    assign seo_description = seo_description | append: ' Original art by Maryna Riepnova, Málaga.'
  endif
endif
```

---

#### C. **Collection Descriptions Too Long**
**Location:** `repka-seo-master.liquid` line 215

**Same Issue:**
```liquid
assign seo_description = collection.description | strip_html | truncatewords: 22, '...'
```
22 words could be 220+ characters!

**Fix:**
```liquid
assign seo_description = collection.description | strip_html | truncate: 155, '...'
```

---

#### D. **Article Excerpts Too Long**
**Location:** `repka-seo-master.liquid` line 233

**Same Issue:**
```liquid
assign seo_description = article.excerpt | strip_html | truncatewords: 22, '...'
```

**Fix:**
```liquid
assign seo_description = article.excerpt | strip_html | truncate: 155, '...'
```

---

### **Issue #2: Why Titles Might Not Be 50-60 Chars**

**Potential Causes:**

#### A. **Shopify Admin Override (Again!)**
**Location:** Product/Collection/Page admin → "Search engine listing preview" → Page title field

**Problem:** Admin titles override code, no character validation

**Solution:** DELETE titles from Shopify Admin, let code handle it

---

#### B. **Long Product/Collection Names**
**Current Logic:** `repka-seo-master.liquid` line 33-48

```liquid
assign seo_title = product.title
# Then appends " - Watercolor Art" or similar
```

**Problem:** If product title is already 50+ characters, appending medium makes it 65-75 chars!

**Example:**
```
Product title: "Mediterranean Sunset Over Málaga Harbor" (44 chars)
After append: "Mediterranean Sunset Over Málaga Harbor - Watercolor Art" (57 chars) ✅
```

BUT:
```
Product title: "Beautiful Handpainted Watercolor Landscape of Costa del Sol" (60 chars)
After append: "Beautiful Handpainted Watercolor Landscape of Costa del Sol - Watercolor Art" (77 chars) 🚨
```

**Current truncation:**
```liquid
if seo_title.size > 60
  assign seo_title = product.title | truncate: 45, '...' | append: ' | Repka Arts'
endif
```

**Problem:** This creates "Beautiful Handpainted Watercolor Lands... | Repka Arts" (awkward!)

**Better Fix:**
```liquid
# Smart truncation that preserves meaning
if seo_title.size > 60
  # Calculate how much space we have
  assign medium_suffix = ' - Watercolor Art'  # 18 chars
  assign brand_suffix = ' | Repka Arts'       # 14 chars
  
  # Try to fit: [Title] - [Medium]
  assign max_title_length = 60 | minus: medium_suffix.size
  if product.title.size > max_title_length
    assign seo_title = product.title | truncate: max_title_length, '' | append: medium_suffix
  endif
  
  # If still too long, go minimal
  if seo_title.size > 60
    assign seo_title = product.title | truncate: 46, '' | append: brand_suffix
  endif
endif
```

---

#### C. **Generic Page Titles**
**Location:** `repka-seo-master.liquid` line 144-150

**Current Fallback:**
```liquid
else
  assign seo_title = page.title | append: ' | Repka Arts Málaga'
```

**Problem:** If page title is "Frequently Asked Questions About Our Art Gallery" (50 chars)
Result: "Frequently Asked Questions About Our Art Gallery | Repka Arts Málaga" (70 chars) 🚨

**Fix:**
```liquid
else
  # Ensure we don't exceed 60 chars
  assign page_title_length = page.title.size
  assign suffix = ' | Repka Arts'
  assign max_length = 60 | minus: suffix.size
  
  if page_title_length > max_length
    assign seo_title = page.title | truncate: max_length, '' | append: suffix
  else
    assign seo_title = page.title | append: suffix
  endif
endif
```

### **Issue #3: Canonical URL Issues in GSC**

**Possible Causes:**

#### A. **Shopify's Default Canonical** (Most Likely!)
**Problem:** Shopify automatically adds its own canonical tag via `{{ content_for_header }}`

**Location:** `theme.liquid` line 48
```liquid
{{ content_for_header }}
```

This outputs Shopify's default meta tags, which **MAY include a duplicate canonical tag**!

**Check by viewing page source:**
```html
<!-- You might see TWO canonical tags: -->
<link rel="canonical" href="...">  <!-- From repka-seo-master.liquid -->
<link rel="canonical" href="...">  <!-- From Shopify's content_for_header -->
```

**Fix:** We need to prevent Shopify's duplicate canonical while keeping other necessary headers.

**Solution 1 (Recommended):** Keep our canonical, but ensure it's correct
```liquid
# In repka-seo-master.liquid, use Shopify's canonical_url variable
assign canonical = canonical_url  # This is already done ✅
```

**Solution 2:** If duplicates exist, we need to modify how Shopify outputs headers (complex)

---

#### B. **Collection Pagination**
**Problem:** Collection pages with `?page=2` might have canonical issues

**Current Code:**
```liquid
assign canonical = canonical_url
```

**Issue:** `canonical_url` for `/collections/watercolors?page=2` should point to page 1, not page 2!

**Proper Fix:**
```liquid
assign canonical = canonical_url

# Remove pagination parameters from canonical
if request.path contains '?page='
  assign canonical = request.origin | append: request.path | split: '?' | first
endif
```

---

#### C. **Product Variant URLs**
**Problem:** `/products/painting?variant=12345` should canonical to `/products/painting`

**Current:** Might be including variant parameter

**Fix:**
```liquid
# Strip variant parameter from canonical
if template contains 'product' and request.path contains '?variant='
  assign canonical = product.url | prepend: request.origin
endif
```

---

## 🔧 ACTION ITEMS

### **Priority 1: Check Shopify Admin (5 minutes)**

1. Go to **Products** → Open any product
2. Scroll to **Search engine listing preview**
3. Check if there's a custom title or description
4. **If yes:** Click "Edit website SEO" and **DELETE** both fields
5. Repeat for 5-10 products

6. Go to **Collections** → Same process
7. Go to **Pages** → Same process

**Why:** Shopify Admin overrides our code. We need to let code handle SEO.

---

### **Priority 2: Update repka-seo-master.liquid (10 minutes)**

Apply the character-based truncation fixes (I can do this for you)

**Changes needed:**
- Line 192: Change `truncatewords: 25` → `truncate: 155`
- Line 215: Change `truncatewords: 22` → `truncate: 155`  
- Line 233: Change `truncatewords: 22` → `truncate: 155`
- Line 52: Add smarter title truncation logic
- Line 338: Add canonical parameter stripping

---

### **Priority 3: Check for Duplicate Canonical Tags (2 minutes)**

1. Visit your live site: `https://repkaarts.com`
2. Right-click → **View Page Source**
3. Search for: `canonical`
4. **Count how many times it appears**

**Expected:** 1 canonical tag
**If you see 2:** We have a duplicate issue to fix

---

### **Priority 4: Google Search Console Specifics**

**Please provide:**
1. Screenshot of the canonical error in GSC
2. List of 3-5 URLs GSC says have issues
3. Specific error message (e.g., "Duplicate without user-selected canonical")

This will help me give you the EXACT fix for your specific issue.
