This means Google is discovering and indexing more pages. The "non-indexed" count includes legitimate exclusions (404s, redirects, etc.).

## Recommended Next Steps:

### Step 1: Download the Detailed URLs
You need to export the specific URLs from Google Search Console for:
- The 901 404 pages
- The 27 canonical duplicate pages
- The 3 server errors

### Step 2: Analyze Patterns
Once you have the URLs, we'll look for patterns:
- Do all 404s end with a specific pattern?
- Are they old products or collection URLs?
- Can we identify why they're 404ing?

### Step 3: Create Action Plan
Based on the patterns, we'll create a prioritized fix list:
1. Fix the 3 server errors (highest priority)
2. Address the 901 404s based on what they are
3. Fix canonical issues
4. Improve content for "crawled not indexed" pages

## Bottom Line

✅ **Good**: Indexed pages increased (1,953 is great!)
⚠️ **Concerning**: The sudden spike in non-indexed pages
🎯 **Focus**: Fix the 901 404s and investigate what happened Oct 12-15

The spike in non-indexed pages is likely just Google discovering lots of new pages (many of which are legitimate 404s or system pages). The important thing is that your indexed count increased significantly!
