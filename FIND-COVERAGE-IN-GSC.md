# How to Find "Coverage" in Google Search Console

## Where to Find It:

1. **Left Sidebar** → Look for a section called **"Indexing"**

2. Under "Indexing" you'll see:
   - **Coverage** ← This is what you want!
   - Sitemaps
   - Removals
   - (These are usually in a collapsible menu)

## Visual Guide:

```
Google Search Console
==================

[Left Sidebar]
- Overview
- Performance        ← Indexing section is usually here
- Indexing           ← Expand this
  ├─ Coverage        ← Click here!
  ├─ Sitemaps
  └─ Removals
- Enhancements
- ...
```

## Alternative Ways to Access:

### Method 1: Search Bar
1. At the top of GSC, there's a search box
2. Type: `coverage`
3. Click "Coverage" from the dropdown

### Method 2: Direct URL
1. If you know your property, you can go directly to:
   `https://search.google.com/search-console/index?resource_id=sc-domain:yourdomain.com&page=coverage`

## What If You Don't See It?

1. **Make sure you're using the right version**:
   - Are you on the new version of Google Search Console?
   - It should say "Search Console" at the top, not "Search Console (legacy)"

2. **Check your property type**:
   - Do you have a Domain property or URL prefix property?
   - Coverage works for both, but the UI might vary slightly

3. **Permissions**:
   - Make sure you have access to the property
   - You need at least "Owner" or "Full User" access

## Need a Screenshot?

If you're still having trouble, can you tell me:
1. What version of Google Search Console you're on?
2. What tabs/sections do you see in the left sidebar?
3. Are you on mobile or desktop?

I can give more specific guidance based on what you're seeing!
