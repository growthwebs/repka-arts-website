# How to Export Products from Shopify

## Steps

1. **Go to Shopify Admin**
   - Log into your Shopify admin panel

2. **Go to Products**
   - Click "Products" in the left sidebar

3. **Click Export**
   - Top right, click "Export" button
   - Choose "Export" (it will be a CSV file)

4. **Save the file**
   - It will be named something like `products_export_2025-10-27.csv`

5. **Send it to me**
   - Open the CSV file
   - Copy a few rows and paste them here (I don't need all rows, just a sample to see the format)
   - Or tell me if you want me to create the redirects a different way

## What I Need From the Export

I'm looking for:
- Product titles
- Product handles (the URL-friendly names)
- Product URLs (if included)

That's it! The handles are what I'll use to create the redirects.

## Alternative: Just Tell Me

If exporting is complicated, you can just tell me:
- "Yes, product handles match the artwork names" (like serenity-in-bloom-n1 â†’ serenity-in-bloom-n1)
- Or "No, they don't match"

And I can adjust the approach accordingly.

**Either way works!** Just let me know which you prefer. ðŸ¤”
