# Quick Action Plan - Fix Your GSC 404 Errors

## ✅ What We Already Fixed

1. **Fixed robots meta tag conflicts** - Removed duplicate tags
2. **Analyzed your data** - Confirmed 901 404 errors
3. **Identified the cause** - Wix → Shopify migration (old `/artwork/` URLs)

## 🚀 What You Need to Do Now (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Remove Old URLs from Google's Index

1. Go to Google Search Console
2. Click **"Removals"** (left sidebar, under Indexing)
3. Click **"New Request"** tab
4. Select **"Temporarily hide URL"**
5. Select the radio button: **"Remove all URLs with this prefix"**
6. In the URL field, enter: `/artwork/`
7. Click **"NEXT"** (button will activate after you enter the URL)
8. Review and confirm

✅ **This tells Google to stop trying to index all old Wix URLs**

### Step 2: Submit Your Current Sitemap

1. In Google Search Console, click **"Sitemaps"** (left sidebar)
2. Check if you see: `sitemap.xml`
3. If not, add it:
   - Enter: `sitemap.xml`
   - Click "Submit"

✅ **This shows Google what URLs currently exist**

## 📅 What to Expect

| Timeline | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| **Day 1** | You submit removal request |
| **Day 2-3** | Removal takes effect |
| **Week 1** | 404 errors start decreasing |
| **Month 1** | 404 errors significantly reduced |
| **Month 2-3** | Coverage report stabilizes |

## 🎯 The Rest Will Fix Itself

- Old Wix URLs will naturally disappear from Google's index
- Your new Shopify structure will be properly indexed
- The 901 404 errors will decrease over time

## ⚠️ International URLs

For URLs like `repkaarts.com/es-int/products/...`:
- If they're working on your live site → Ignore the GSC error (it will resolve)
- If they're not working → Let them naturally decay

## Summary

**You don't need to create redirects or do anything complex.**

Just:
1. Submit URL removal for `/artwork/` ✅
2. Make sure sitemap is submitted ✅
3. Wait for Google to learn your new structure ✅

That's it! Your migration is handling this normally. 🎉
